The Bank Management Project using Python is a console-based application designed to simulate basic banking operations through programming. The project demonstrates how Python can be used to manage banking activities such as account creation, deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry, and transaction records.

This project helps in understanding the practical application of programming logic, data structures, and file handling in managing banking data securely and efficiently. It also highlights how automation improves accuracy, speed, and reliability in bank management systems.

Overall, the project combines banking concepts with Python programming, making it useful for students to learn both technical and managerial aspects of banking operations.
